This AutoHotkey (AHK) script allows you to control the transparency of a selected window on your desktop. 
Itâ€™s designed to be user-friendly, even for those with no previous experience with AHK. Hereâ€™s how to use it:

Select a Window: To select a window that you want to control, make sure the window is active 
(i.e., itâ€™s the last window you clicked on or interacted with). 
Then, hold down the â€˜Altâ€™ key and press â€˜4â€™. This action saves the ID of the active window for later use.

Toggle Transparency: Once youâ€™ve selected a window, you can make it transparent or opaque. 
To make the window transparent, hold down the â€˜Altâ€™ key and press â€˜5â€™. 
To revert the window back to its original state (i.e., make it opaque), hold down the â€˜Altâ€™ key and press â€˜6â€™.

Adjust Transparency: If a window is set to be transparent, you can adjust the level of transparency while the window is on top. 
To increase transparency, hold down the â€˜Altâ€™ key and press the â€˜+â€™ key on the numeric keypad. 
To decrease transparency, hold down the â€˜Altâ€™ key and press the â€˜-â€™ key on the numeric keypad.

Script Indicator: While the script is running, youâ€™ll see a green icon with the letter â€˜Hâ€™ in your taskbar. 
This icon indicates that the AHK script is active and ready to use.

Remember, this script is designed to give you control over the transparency of your windows, 
allowing you to customize your desktop experience to suit your needs. Enjoy using it! ðŸ˜Š
